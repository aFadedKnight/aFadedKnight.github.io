The Final project for my first CGI class was to recreate some sort of power tool. A power tool was defined as anything the requires some kind of power in order to make it fully functional. This could be gas, electricity, ect. For my final I chose to model my pair of wireless headphones that I used at the time.

## Project Details

This was meant to be a project that would challenge us to learn modeling based off of a real world object that we owned. The final model needed to be as accurate as possible to the original including the textures showing it's age and that it has been used.

For the final submission we needed to submit a few different renders, one of which placing our object into a photo that we took where it also makes sense for it to be. I chose a photo I took of my setup and decided to place it in the empty space to the table. This taught me how to use shadow materials and matching the lighting from a real photo in the 3D scene.
