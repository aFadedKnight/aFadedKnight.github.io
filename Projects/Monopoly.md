My first ever 3d animation was a project I made in high school. It was based off of a 2D animation I made in my first animation class in high school which was all 2D. My second class was also meant to be 2D but my teacher allowed me to do projects in 3D.

</div>

Although this isn't anything amazing I am still proud of this animation being my first. These were some of my first ever models and my first fully rendered animation.
